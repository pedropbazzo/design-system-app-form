## Why remove the builders?

- Builders serves more of a purpose in the original FormMaster repository to quickly build form elements by chaining setters
- Setters in KFormMaster were kept to provide some compatibility with Java and limit the properties in the Kotlin Form DSL
- Compatibility with Java was fixed in a recent update by removing the original builder methods in the Form Element classes
- Now, the only purpose of the builder classes was to build form elements in the Form DSL
- The builder classes create too much redundancy in the code and cause issues with the Dex file that is created

## Migrate to Form Element Classes

1. Remove builder imports
2. Replace ".build()" with ""
3. Replace Builder Classes with Form Element Classes
